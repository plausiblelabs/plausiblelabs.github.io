                Plausible Labs supports creative and scientific expression, transparent collaboration, and independent

                            continuity to our customers, and contributions to our local communities.

                            research and development, and distribute a share of revenue and profits each year
                            consistent with reasonable investor and employee expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We must be adaptable and decisive in the face of rapid shifts in the technology industry.

                            around our products are improved by openly sharing our contributions to the theory,
                            science, and application of our craft.

                            We grow our business by providing customers with genuine value in exchange for a fair
                            price. We do not build products supported by advertising or "free-to-play" micro-
                            transactions. While we recognize the market value therein, we do not feel these business
                            models are aligned with the company's long-term goals.

                            service; we provide locally installable purchasing options for our cloud software, and
                            interoperate with other vendors whenever feasible.

                            Our products are built using open standards, including our own published standards. By
                            leading technical innovation while encouraging interoperability, we can create a richer
                            ecosystem within which our products benefit from a vibrant and complementary market of
                            interoperable products and services.

                            We are forthright in documenting when and how customer data might be accessed, shared, or

                            of our products and meet our lawful obligations.
