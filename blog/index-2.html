                    <title>PLRelational: Query Optimization and Execution</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/10/03/plrelational-query-optimization</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We've been talking a lot about PLRelational lately and what you can do with it. Today I want to talk about some of its internals. In particular, I want to talk about how it optimizes and executes queries, which is one of the most interesting components of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>Let's Build with PLRelational, Part 2</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/09/28/build-with-plrelational-part-2</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 of this article, we used PLRelational to build a portion of a to-do application for macOS. In this article, we will follow the same process and focus on building out the right-hand side of the application, specifically the detail view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/09/18/build-with-plrelational-part-1</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Our goal with this article is to give a big picture look at PLRelational and how it can be used to build an actual application. We will show how you can do things the PLRelational Way, and that will give us a baseline to help compare and contrast to existing technologies in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>The Best New Features in Swift 4</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/09/13/best-new-features-in-swift-4</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Swift 4 is here, and it's bringing some nice changes. We're not getting a radical rework of the syntax like we did last year, nor are we getting a breathtaking pile of new features like we did for Swift 2, but there are some nice additions you can use to improve your code. L...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>PLRelational: Storage Formats</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/09/07/plrelational-storage-formats</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We've been talking a lot lately about PLRelational and all the fancy stuff it does. However, we've been glossing over a fundamental part of it: how it actually stores data. After all, PLRelational is a data persistence framework at its core.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>PLRelational: Observing Change</title>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Before looking into all the goodies that PLRelational and PLRelationalBinding have to offer, it helps to first understand how the core Relation classes compute and deliver changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>An Introduction to Relational Algebra Using PLRelational</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/08/24/intro-to-relational-algebra-using-plrelational</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently announced PLRelational, our framework for storing and working with data that is based on relational algebra. This raises the question: what exactly is relational algebra? Most of the material out there is either highly academic, or focused on SQL databases. This ...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>Reactive Relational Programming with PLRelational</title>
                    <link>http://plausible.coop/blog/2017/08/10/reactive-relational-programming-with-plrelational</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on the next major version of VoodooPad [1], an observation was made: user interfaces are basically &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; bidirectional transformation functions, taking data from some source and presenting it to the user, and vice versa. It sounds so simple when boiled down...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
