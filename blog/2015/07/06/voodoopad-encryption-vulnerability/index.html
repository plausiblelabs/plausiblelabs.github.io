                    <a href="#">VoodooPad Encryption Vulnerability</a>
                </h1>
                <p class="author">July 6, 2015, by Landon Fuller</p>
                <p>After Plausible Labs’ acquisition of VoodooPad, a cryptography audit was performed and VoodooPad’s document encryption implementation was found to use weak or improperly employed cryptographic primitives. The discovered issues include weak key derivation, use of known-weak ciphers, predictable RNG seeding, and improper IV re-use.</p><p>As a result, an attacker with access to an encrypted document may be able to decrypt the document’s contents without access to the original encryption password.</p><p>To resolve these issues, we’ve invested heavily in a complete redesign and rewrite of VoodooPad’s encryption implementation; as of VoodooPad 5.1.4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All VoodooPad releases now ship with an encryption implementation based on industry standards and best practices.</li>
  <li>VoodooPad will display a warning upon opening an insecurely encrypted document, and will optionally perform an in-place upgrade of the document’s encryption.</li>
  <li>We have published complete technical specifications documenting VoodooPad’s new encryption implementation; refer to “Additional Resources” below.</li>
</ul><p>Due to the sweeping implementation changes that were required in VoodooPad’s document storage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encrypted documents produced in VoodooPad 5.1.4 and later will not be readable in earlier releases of VoodooPad.</li>
  <li>We are initially releasing VoodooPad 5.1.4 as a <a href="https://www.plausible.coop/voodoopad/release_notes#5.1.4b2">public beta</a> to allow for further testing while allowing affected customers to upgrade immediately. We do recommend that affected customers <a href="https://www.plausible.coop/voodoopad/release_notes#5.1.4b2">upgrade now</a>.</li>
</ul><h2>Common Questions</h2><h4>I’m a VoodooPad user but I don’t use encryption. I didn’t even know VoodooPad had encryption! Do I have anything to worry about?</h4><p>Nope! This issue only applies to documents using encryption.</p><h4>I have some encrypted VoodooPad documents. How could this impact me?</h4><p>Unfortunately, anyone that is able to gain access to your VoodooPad-encrypted documents can potentially decrypt any document that was encrypted with a previous VoodooPad release, even if they do not know the document password.</p><p>When using a cloud file or backup service, encrypted VoodooPad documents could be decrypted by anyone with access to your account (including the cloud service provider).</p><p>For documents stored locally on your computer, an attacker would require access to your computer, or access to your local files via another means — such as unencrypted backups.</p><h4>OK — So how do I secure my documents?</h4><p>The first step is to upgrade to the <a href="https://www.plausible.coop/voodoopad/release_notes#5.1.4b2">VoodooPad 5.1.4 Beta</a> release. If you’re a Mac App Store customer, you’ll need to download the beta from the provided link instead of the App Store, but you won’t need to purchase a separate license. If you are an iOS user, reading securely encrypted documents will also require <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voodoopad/id777792045">VoodooPad 5.1.4 for iOS</a>, available as a free upgrade via the App Store.</p><p>Next, open your encrypted documents (or documents containing encrypted pages) with VoodooPad 5.1.4 on Mac OS X — VoodooPad will offer to upgrade the documents immediately in-place. An unmodified copy of your document will also be placed in the Trash — you may wish to empty the trash after you’ve verified that your document has been upgraded successfully.</p><p>Lastly, be aware that cloud services like Dropbox may store backup copies of files, and those backups may include an insecurely encrypted version of your document. You can request that Dropbox <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/115">permanently delete</a> a file, but just to be safe, we recommend saving a local backup of the file on your own computer first.</p><h4>What if I’m using VoodooPad 4 or earlier?</h4><p>Previous releases of VoodooPad used a different design for document and page encryption; unfortunately, this was also found to use weak or improperly employed cryptographic primitives. We recommend that all customers upgrade to VoodooPad 5.</p><p>Discounted upgrade pricing is available to direct-purchase customers via the <a href="../../../../../store">Plausible Store</a>. For Mac App Store customers, Apple does not support discount upgrade pricing via the Mac App Store – if you previously purchased VoodooPad 4 through the Mac App Store, please <a href="mailto:support@plausible.coop">contact us directly</a> to arrange for upgrade pricing.</p><h2>Additional Resources</h2><p>We’ve published additional technical details on the design and implementation of VoodooPad 5.1.4′s document encryption implementation, including:</p>
